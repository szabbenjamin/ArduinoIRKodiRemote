# ArduinoIRKodiRemote
IR Remote with Arduino to Kodi

This is a remote control to Kodi if you have an Arduino and an IR receiver.

*Install*

Install Kodi.

Connect your Arduino to PC, check your IR receiver.

Burn the IRRemote.ino code to Arduino.

Open the Visual Studio project (I have VS'13).

Open COM connection over PuTTY to Arduino.

Check your remote keyboard layout and fix it in Visual Studio project. The "\r\n" chars stay in end of line.

If you're ready build it and run. 

Press the power button. Kodi will be open.

Enjoy!
